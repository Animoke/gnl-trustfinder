# gnl-trustfinder

**get_next_line tester**

# Usage

Change your gnl directory in 𝘨𝘯𝘭-𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳.𝘴𝘩 :
src_path="*../yourpath*" --- default path is "*../gnl*"

`./gnl-trustfinder [-$f] [$option]`
`./gnl-trustfinder [--$flag] [$option]`

	-h | --help display help message 
	-t | --test test flag
options: 
	**n** | **normal** 	normal mode
	 **l** | **leaks** 		only tests leaks 
	**b** | **bonus** 		only tests bonus 
	**a** | **all** 		all tests 
	**hf** | **huge-file** 	test with huge file (48000 lines)

**Example**: running ./gnl-trustfinder -t b will test for bonus, without testing the rest.

The flags are interchangeable, meaning that it does not matter if you type the short flag with a full option and vice-versa.

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|


Features:

-   Normal mode: The normal mode will compile your files with a BUFFER_SIZE of 1 to 8. It will then compare the output of the binary and compare it with the input file (in the diff/ directory when the programm is running). The leaks test uses -𝘧𝘴𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘻𝘦=𝘢𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴 on compilation to look for more informations if there are leaks.
    
-   Leaks mode: This mode will do the same as the normal mode, but skipping the comparison.
    
-   Bonus mode: This mode will compile with BUFFER_SIZE 1 and 512, and then compare the output of the binaries to the input file. The leaks test works the same way as it does in normal mode
    
-   All tests mode: This mode will run normal mode and bonus mode. It will be improved in the future to add all the features.
    
-   Huge-file mode: This mode will generate a huge file (48000 lines) into diff/huge (this operation takes about 20-30 seconds) It will the compile like the normal mode, and compare the diff/huge file with the output of your gnl.
    

Feature to come:

-   huge-buf-size mode, a mode that compiles with different and random BUFFER_SIZE between 1 and 4096.
